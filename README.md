## Testing

The testing strategy for this project is based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): test runner developed by Facebook, it ships with `create-react-app`. It is also used to mock some of the modules that are required on the tests.

The main principle behind the testing philosophy of this approach is:
> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.


### How to run tests

To start watch mode, just do:

```bash
yarn test
```

It is suggested that you keep your terminal opened while in watch mode. As you edit your code, your tests will be automatically re-run. Look at the terminal for more instructions on the watch mode usage.

## Routes

This project is using [`react-router-dom`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core).

There are several routes to navigate to different pages of the app:

- Profile - user info page.
- *Messages - maintained*
- Friends - users list with sorting
- Chat - websocket public chat

## State management

Redux whith Redux middleware.
